# Handwritten-Digit-classifier
 This is the implementation of a multilayer neural network.
Done in python and numpy with no external machine learning framework used.This NN gives accuracy upto 95-96%.
The purpose of this project was to understand the full architecture of a neural network and to visually break down what's going on while training to recognize handwritten digits.

## Setting up:

```
git clone https://github.com/agarwalgaurav811/Handwritten-Digit-classifier.git
```
```
cd Handwritten-Digit-classifier/
```
```
python network.py
```
